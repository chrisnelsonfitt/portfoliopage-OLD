    <p>The main focus for this project was to create a video player and custom skin for said player. along side the custom skin for this player I have also included a script for the video that highlights as the video plays as well as the ability to click anywhere on the script and to jump to that spot on the video. <br>
    </p> 
    <h4> Highlights:</h4>
    <ul>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>CSS3</li>
            <li>SASS</li>
            <li>Media Queries </li>
            <li>JavaScrip</li>
            <li>Plugin</li>
        
        
    </ul>
